Pixelit is a desktop image processing and editing application built with C++, Qt (QML + Qt Core), and OpenCV.
The project focuses on efficient image manipulation, real-time preview, and a clean, extensible architecture suitable for advanced computer vision and image processing workflows.

Pixelit is designed as a lightweight yet powerful image editor, showcasing strong fundamentals in image processing, UI-to-native integration, and performance-oriented C++ development.

✨ Features
🖼️ Image Processing & Editing

Load and process images using OpenCV

Real-time preview of applied transformations

Non-destructive editing pipeline (operations applied in sequence)

🔍 Transformations

Gaussian Blur

Sharpen

Edge Detection

🎛️ Image Adjustments

Brightness

Contrast

Saturation

Exposure

Invert Colors

Grayscale (adjustment mode)

Sepia (adjustment mode)

Sharpen (intensity-based)

🧩 Architecture Highlights

Clean separation between UI (QML) and image processing logic (C++ / OpenCV)

Modular filter and adjustment pipeline

Designed for easy extension (new filters or tools can be added without refactoring core logic)

Thread-safe image processing for smooth UI interaction

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++ (C++17)

Qt 6

Qt Quick (QML)

Qt Core / GUI

OpenCV

CMake

QML Image Provider

Multithreading (std::thread)

🧠 Image Processing Techniques

Pixelit uses classic and efficient image processing techniques provided by OpenCV:

🔹 Filters & Effects

Color space conversions (BGR ↔ Gray)

Convolution-based filters (Gaussian Blur, Sharpen)

Edge detection (Sobel / Canny-based)

Pixel-level transformations (Invert, Sepia)

🔹 Adjustments

Linear and non-linear pixel intensity mapping

Contrast stretching

Brightness and exposure correction

Saturation manipulation in HSV color space

⚙️ Setup & Development
✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Qt 6.x

Qt Quick

Qt Widgets

OpenCV

CMake ≥ 3.16

C++17 compatible compiler

MSVC / GCC / Clang

🔧 OpenCV Setup

Ensure OpenCV is correctly installed and accessible.

Example (Windows):

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Muhammedsuwaneh/pixelit

# Navigate to the project folder
cd pixelit


In your CMakeLists.txt:

set(OpenCV_DIR "C:/opencv/build")
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)


Verify:

OpenCV core modules are detected

Image loading and processing work correctly

🏗️ Build the Project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .


Or open the project directly in Qt Creator and configure it with CMake.

▶️ Run the Application

After building:

Run from Qt Creator, or

Execute the generated binary from the build directory

Make sure:

Image files are accessible

Required OpenCV DLLs / shared libraries are in the runtime path
